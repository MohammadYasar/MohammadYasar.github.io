I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate at [Rice University](https://www.rice.edu), working with [Prof. Kavraki](https://profiles.rice.edu/faculty/lydia-e-kavraki), [Prof. Unhelkar](https://profiles.rice.edu/faculty/vaibhav-unhelkar), and [Prof. Ordonez](https://profiles.rice.edu/faculty/vicente-ordonez-roman). My research focuses on the intersection of Vision and Language Models and Robotics.

I earned my Ph.D. from the [University of Virginia's](http://virginia.edu/)  Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, where I worked on "Learning Interpretable and Scalable Representations for Human-Robot Collaboration" under the guidance of [Prof. Tariq Iqbal](https://www.tiqbal.com/). During my Ph.D., I completed a summer research internship at Microsoft, collaborating with [Sean Andrist](https://seanandrist.com/) and [Dan Bohus](https://www.danbohus.com/).

Prior to my Ph.D., I worked as a Strategic Planning Analyst at MGH Group Bangladesh for two years. I hold a B.Sc. in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from BRAC University.
